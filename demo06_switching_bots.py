# This demo shows how to combine the strategies of the basic attacker and the
# basic defender
# Initially, one bot is in attack mode, while the other uses the defending
# strategy. Once the attacking bot is killed, it restarts as a defender, while
# the previous defender changes its personality and becomes the new attacker.
